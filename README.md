Landing Page

A multi-section landing page, with a functional, dynamic navigation menu.In this project I will build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. 

I received great guidance, encouragement and support during connect sessions. My session lead was very thorough in helping talk through getting the code worked out.



# Usage
This project is a functional homepage that allows for a dynamic navigation bar, based on the number of sections per page. Also, an active state to viewed section and clicking the navigation item will scroll to the appropriate section.
